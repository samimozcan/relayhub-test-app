# Copilot Instructions for Folder Reader App

This is a Node.js TypeScript application that reads folders and logs their names.

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts` - Main application file that contains the folder reading logic
- Built using TypeScript with strict type checking
- Uses Node.js built-in `fs` and `path` modules for filesystem operations

## Coding Conventions

- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Include proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow Node.js filesystem best practices
